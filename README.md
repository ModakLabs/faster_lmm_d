# Faster_lmm_d

A faster lmm for GWAS. GPU support coming soon.

NOTICE: this software is under active development. YMMV.

# Introduction

Faster_lmm_d is a lightweight linear mixed-model solver for use in
genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The original is similar to
FaST-LMM (an algorithm by Lippert et al.) and that code base can be
found [here](https://github.com/nickFurlotte/pylmm). Prof. Karl Broman
wrote a comparison with his
[R/lmmlite](http://kbroman.org/lmmlite/assets/lmmlite.html). Faster_lmm_d
and pylmm are part of the
[Genenetwork2](https://github.com/genenetwork) project. faster_lmm_d
can parse data in
[R/qtl2 format](http://kbroman.org/qtl2/assets/vignettes/input_files.html)
as input.

# Install

## Requirements

`faster_lmm_d` is written in the fast D language and requires a D
compiler. At the moment we also use openblas, lapacke and gsl
libraries.

### On Debian/Ubuntu

Install

```sh
sudo apt-get install libopenblas liblapacke libgsl2
```

Install LDC

```
sudo apt-get install ldc2
```

### On GNU Guix

```sh
guix package -i ldc dub openblas gsl lapack
```

## Get the source

Get the source-code

```sh
git clone https://github.com/prasunanand/faster_lmm_d
cd faster_lmm_d
```

Fetch dependencies and compile

CPU Backend:
```sh
make
```
CUDA Backend:
```sh
make CUDA=1
```
ARRAYFIRE Backend:
```sh
make ARRAYFIRE=1
```

or in the case of GNU Guix (because dub does not honour the
LIBRARY_PATH):

```sh
export LIBRARY_PATH=~/.guix-profile/lib
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH dub --compiler=ldc2
```

Usage example

```sh
./faster_lmm_d --control=data/genenetwork/BXD.json --pheno=data/genenetwork/104617_at.json --geno=data/genenetwork/BXD.csv --cmd=rqtl
```

## Testing

To run tests

```sh
time ./run_tests.sh
```

If you get an error (on GNU Guix)

```sh
./build/faster_lmm_d: error while loading shared libraries: libgsl.so.19: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

try

```sh
time env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH ./run_tests.sh
```

## Performance Profiling

Install google-perftools and graphviz

```sh
sudo apt-get install google-perftools libgoogle-perftools-dev graphviz
```

Install go and then install google-pprof.

```sh
go get github.com/google/pprof
```

To profile uncomment out the code import `gperftools_d.profiler;`, `ProfilerStart()` and `ProfilerStop()` in
the `main` function in `source/faster_lmm_d/app.d`.

```sh
make run-gperf
```
